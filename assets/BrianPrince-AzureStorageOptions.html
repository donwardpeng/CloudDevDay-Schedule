		Enough mushy, baby talk about the cloud. Let’s roll up our sleeves and talk
	about some real patterns for how to use the cloud in the real world.
	Hint: As much as some vendors want you to think so, it doesn’t require
	you to move everything to the cloud. Leave with some concrete ways to
	use the cloud in your existing world.
	<br><br>Expect <strong>Brian </strong> to get (in his own words) “super excited”
	whenever he talks about technology, especially cloud computing,
	patterns, and practices. That’s a good thing, given that his job is to
	help customers strategically leverage Microsoft technologies and take
	their architecture to new heights. Before joining Microsoft in March
	2008, Brian was senior director of technology strategy for a major
	Midwest partner and has over 13 years of expertise in information
	technology management. His consulting experience includes e-commerce,
	extranets and business technology for numerous industries, including
	real estate, financial services, health care, retail, and state
	government institutions. Brian also has exceptional proficiency in the
	Microsoft .NET framework, Service Oriented Architecture, building ESBs,
	and both smart client and web based applications. Brian’s the
	co-founder of the non-profit organization CodeMash (<a href="www.codemash.org">www.codemash.org</a> ),
	runs the global Windows Azure Boot Camp program, and speaks at various
	regional and international technology events. Armed with a Bachelor of
	Arts degree in Computer Science and Physics from Capital University in
	Columbus, Ohio, Brian is a zealous gamer with a special weakness for
	Fallout 3. Brian is the co-author of “Azure in Action”, published by
	Manning Press.

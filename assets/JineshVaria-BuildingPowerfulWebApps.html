<strong>Jinesh Varia</strong> will give the morning Keynote presentation at CloudDevDay.
<br><br>
The cloud reinforces some old concepts of building highly scalable 
architectures and introduces some new concepts that entirely change the 
way applications are built, developed and deployed. In order to leverage
 the full potential of the cloud and enjoy all the benefits it has to 
offer, it is important to understand these concepts and make them 
intrinsic part of your cloud-based application architecture. These 
concepts are highlighted in the whitepaper 
<a href="http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf">Architecting for the Cloud : Best Practices</a>
 which is referenced and cited in several journals. This session will 
discuss these concepts with examples and highlight some basic patterns, 
tactics and practices that you as developer and architect can easily 
incorporate and implement. In other words, this session will help you 
answer the question <em>“How to think cloud? </em> and 
<em> How to architect future applications with the cloud in mind?”. </em>The
 session will be ideal for enterprise architects and technical decision 
makers who already have basic understanding of cloud computing and 
Amazon Web Services offerings.

		<strong>Nilanjan Raychaudhuri </strong>is a
		technologist/Consultant/Author working with Pillar Technology Inc.,
		focused on automation and continual improvement of software processes.
		He helps clients improve their software development processes using
		Agile and Lean practices. Being polyglot programmer he tends to use
		multiple programming languages like Ruby, Groovy, Scala and Java in
		his job. He has been working in the software industry for more than
		ten years. He is also working on a book project called “Scala in
		Action” for Manning publications. <br> <br>At CloudDevDay
		Nilanjan will be teaching a session on Akka and Cloudy Akka. Akka is a
		framework written in Scala that provides the right abstract level
		needed to write fault tolerant and scalable applications both in Scala
		and Java. <br> <br> Akka uses Actors together with Software
		Transactional Memory (STM) to create a unified runtime and programming
		model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT
		(utilizing the grid/cloud). Akka provides location and network
		transparency by abstracting away both these tangents of scalability by
		turning them into an operations and configuration task. This gives the
		Akka runtime freedom to do adaptive automatic load-balancing, cluster
		rebalancing, replication and partitioning. Akka is available at <a
			href="http://akka.io">http://akka.io</a> (under Apache 2 license).
		Cloudy Akka is a suite of enterprise add-on modules for Akka.

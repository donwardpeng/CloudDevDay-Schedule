		Many organizations are a little shy when it comes to adopting the
		cloud, for several reasons. Most are slowly adopting the cloud by
		using a hybrid architecture strategy. Couple this strategy with the
		need to increase scale and speed on your web application, without
		taking the big cloud jump. We will look at how to achieve this with a
		low cost and low risk strategy of keeping your app where it is, but
		leveraging cloud storage and caching to achieve great scale and
		performance. <br>
		<br>Expect <strong>Brian </strong> to get (in his own words)
		“super excited” whenever he talks about technology, especially cloud
		computing, patterns, and practices. That’s a good thing, given that
		his job is to help customers strategically leverage Microsoft
		technologies and take their architecture to new heights. Before
		joining Microsoft in March 2008, Brian was senior director of
		technology strategy for a major Midwest partner and has over 13 years
		of expertise in information technology management. His consulting
		experience includes e-commerce, extranets and business technology for
		numerous industries, including real estate, financial services, health
		care, retail, and state government institutions. Brian also has
		exceptional proficiency in the Microsoft .NET framework, Service
		Oriented Architecture, building ESBs, and both smart client and web
		based applications. Brian’s the co-founder of the non-profit
		organization CodeMash (<a href="www.codemash.org">www.codemash.org</a>
		), runs the global Windows Azure Boot Camp program, and speaks at
		various regional and international technology events. Armed with a
		Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Physics from Capital
		University in Columbus, Ohio, Brian is a zealous gamer with a special
		weakness for Fallout 3. Brian is the co-author of “Azure in Action”,
		published by Manning Press.

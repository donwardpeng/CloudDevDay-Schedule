 on Development Operations. Development Operations (DevOps) brings to 
infrastructure what Agile has been doing for almost a decade prior with 
software. There lies a disconnect in many working environments between 
system administration and software development teams. On the system 
administration side, little has been changing in terms of process and 
methodologies employed, while software developers are breaking the mold 
and finding better efficiency and maintainability of their code-bases. 
DevOps provides the system administrator with a set of methodologies 
that can be implemented to take back their infrastructure. Come learn 
how a Linux system administrator can use a diverse set of tools and 
process to not only create and maintain better infrastructure, but also 
close the gap with their software developer counter-parts.</p>

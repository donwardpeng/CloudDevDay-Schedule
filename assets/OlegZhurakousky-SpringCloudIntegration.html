		Cloud deployment is forcing a fundamental shift in enterprise
		application architecture towards a highly distributed, highly
		parallelized, horizontal scale-out services model. The Java
		classloader can no longer be the “spider in the middle of the web” as
		it was with traditional vertical scale-up JEE deployment. Traditional
		means of scale-out based on the JEE deployment model (Business Process
		Management, Enterprise Services Bus) are showing their limitations in
		cloud deployment because they simply re-create the same “spider in the
		middle of the web” problem at a different, higher level of
		abstraction.Additionally, when it comes to granularity of the services
		tier, there is no “one size fits all” answer. In fact, even for a
		single service, as business events change driving peaks and valleys in
		load, the level of granularity best suited for the deployment of that
		service will likely change as well. This means that Java components
		must be able to be flexibly composed into light-weight services that
		can be easily distributed and parallelized to take advantage of the
		cloud deployment model.Over the past several years, with the emergence
		of J2SE-based frameworks, open TCP-based protocols for messaging, and
		noSQL data stores, it is easier than ever to deliver cost-effective
		solutions that enable the flexible distribution and parallelization of
		your business applications within the cloud. This new breed of
		middleware allows you to base your cloud application architecture on
		distributed light-weight Java-based components that use simple, open
		messaging, rather than a centralized shared classloader, for
		inter-process communication and a distributed in-memory data fabric,
		rather than a centralized data store, for sharing data. This
		presentation will demonstrate how a legacy, vertically-integrated Java
		application can be quickly re-factored toward a more flexible, modular
		distributed architecture using Spring technologies that are optimized
		for the cloud. Oleg is a Sr. Software Engineer with
		SpringSource/VMWare and has 14+ years of experience in software
		engineering across multiple disciplines including software
		architecture and design, consulting, business analysis and application
		development. <br> <br> Oleg is a committer on the Spring
		Integration project and he has been delivering presentations at user
		groups and conferences around the in the US and Europe on
		messaging/integration in the Cloud, the Spring Framework, Spring
		Integration, and OSGi. He is currently collaborating with others at
		SpringSource on Cloud Foundry. <br>
		<br> After starting his career in the world of COBOL &amp; CICS,
		Oleg has been focusing on professional Java and Java EE development
		since 1999. Since 2004 he has been heavily involved in using several
		open source technologies and platforms with Spring Framework at the
		forefront, while working on a number of projects around the world and
		spanning industries such as Telecommunication, Banking, Law
		Enforcement, US DOD and others. Oleg’s current passions include Event
		Driven Architecture (EDA), Grid Computing, Test Driven development and
		Aspect Oriented Programming while his Spring passions are aligned with
		Spring Integration framework (<a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration"
			http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration</a>) where Oleg is a
		core committer. <br><br> A resident of the Philadelphia
		area, Oleg enjoys windsurfing, scuba diving, snowboarding, hockey and
		traveling when he can find some spare time.

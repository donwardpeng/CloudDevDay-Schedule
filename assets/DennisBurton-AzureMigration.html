		There you are looking up at all of these cloud applications wondering
		“Just how am I going to get there”. In this session we will look at
		the key considerations around the process of migrating your production
		web application with a SQL Server back end to the Windows Azure
		platform. We will then walk through a series of identified steps that
		will allow you to migrate a piece of the application at a time all
		while continuing to serve up pages. You will walk away from this
		session with the real world tools necessary to start migrating your
		own applications. <br> <br> <strong>Dennis Burton </strong>is
		a web developer with SRT Solutions whose diverse portfolio includes
		online learning management systems, precision measurement using high
		speed data acquisition applications, as well as automotive diagnostic
		software. Since the beginning of his career, he has been working with
		systems that require processing large amounts of data quickly. Dennis
		has been around long enough to be old to some and young to others, but
		firmly believes that what you do with your time is more important than
		how long you have been spending it. As an active member of the
		development community, Dennis serves on the board of the Lansing .NET
		User Group, the Ann Arbor .NET User Group and as an organizer for the
		Lansing Day of .NET. You can find him rambling on as @dburton on
		Twitter and on his blog at <a href="http://developusing.net">http://developusing.net</a>.

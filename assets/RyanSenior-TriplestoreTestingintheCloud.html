Ryan Senior is a Senior Engineer at Revelytix Inc writing Semantic Web 
software in Clojure. Previously he worked as a Software Architect in the
 Emerging Solutions department of BJC Healthcare. He has worked in many 
other industries including insurance, finance and manufacturing. His 
main interests are software design, programming languages and the 
semantic web. At CloudDevDay Ryan will present: “Triplestore Testing in the Cloud with Clojure”. 
This talk comes from last year’s Strange Loop Conference. Determining
 what RDF repository to use for a project can be a daunting task. With 
so many repository choices, benchmarks and usage scenarios, where do you
 start? This talk discusses how Revelytix answered that question. The 
talk will cover the test framework written by Revelytix in Clojure, 
including a language for defining tests, a harness for executing the 
tests and using CouchDB to store the results. Example Clojure code will 
be included along with a discussion around the available RDF benchmarks.
 The talk will also discuss the test harness using EC2 instances for 
cheap performance testing and how we interpreted those results using 
Incanter.</p>

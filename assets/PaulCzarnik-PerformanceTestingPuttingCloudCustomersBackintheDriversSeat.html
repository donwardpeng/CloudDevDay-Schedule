Technology Association of Michigan and Motown Museum. At CloudDevDay 
Paul will present Performance Testing: Putting Cloud Customers Back in the Driver’s Seat.
<br><br>Today, cloud service providers’ SLAs are incomplete, woefully inadequate and 
far too generic in addressing specific application and service 
performance requirements for individual business customers. 
Businesses need to demand more relevant, performance-focused SLAs from 
their cloud service providers. Currently, cloud SLAs are a work in
 progress and will evolve only when customers demand them. The 
onus for testing, measuring and validating performance lies with testers
 at the businesses considering or using cloud services. Determine 
exactly why you are using the cloud and articulate performance 
requirements. Testers need to commit to ongoing, rigorous performance 
testing. Monitoring the performance of any vendor can take 
extra time and money, attend and learn solutions that can make testing 
faster and easier, as well as more comprehensive, cost-effective and 
reflective of the true end-user experience. Learn performance 
tests and measurements that can be the key to creating SLAs that drive 
greater confidence and wider adoption of cloud computing for 
mission-critical applications. The solutions introduced will help 
businesses derive the flexibility, scalability, cost and management 
benefits they seek while remaining active participants in guaranteeing 
performance.</p>

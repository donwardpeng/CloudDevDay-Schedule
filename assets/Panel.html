		<strong>Matt Roush </strong>has agreed to emcee CloudDevDay by doing
		the morning introductions and moderating a panel discussion
		during lunch. Matt joined WWJ Newsradio 950 in 2001 to
		spearhead the launch of the Great Lakes IT Report, a daily e-mail
		newsletter covering the technology world from a Michigan perspective.
		GLITR, as the publication is known, covers tech broadly, including
		hardware, software, advanced manufacturing, life sciences, tech
		education, automotive telematics, and most recently, renewable energy
		technologies. Prior to joining WWJ and GLITR, Roush spent more
		than 10 years at Crain’s Detroit <a id="itxthook0"
			href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/personality/matt-roush/#"
			rel="nofollow">Business</a> as a reporter. Hired in 1990 to
		cover banking and finance, Roush’s beat switched to retailing in 1994.
		While covering retailing, Roush discovered a then-novel medium called
		the Internet, and was instantly hooked. In 1998 he started covering
		technology full-time, and helped launch a tech news Web site for
		Crain’s, CrainTech.com, in 2000.
	</p>

	<p>Prior to Crain’s, Roush covered beats as varied as
		business, health care, local government and real estate for the
		Kalamazoo Gazette, the Traverse City Record-Eagle, the
		Leelanau Enterprise and the Three Rivers Commercial. Roush, a
		resident of Dearborn, is active in his community and church. He has
		won numerous journalism awards from the Associated Press, UPI and the
		Association of Area Business Publications. His hobbies include
		cooking, camping, hiking, cross-country skiing, astronomy, gardening,
		and building and flying model rockets. Roush is a native of Three
		Rivers and a 1978 graduate of Albion College.</p>
